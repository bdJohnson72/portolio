                    <p>
                        I ask myself that same question. In the summer of 2016 I retired from the Army after 21 years of active duty and
                        26 years of total service. I was not sure what I was going to do next and was unprepared for how difficult a complete 
                        midlife career tranistion would be. five years later I think I am still plugging away at it. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That first job out of the Army involved working on the Salesforce platform. Nothing too serious but enough to learn what
                        it was. I had never heard of Salesforce in 44 years. At some point I discovered Trailhead and Vetforce, the Salesforce 
                        training program for veterans. And I taught myself to code. This website is really for the self taught programmer and the 
                        career changer. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think that most develper blogs present a shiny finished package and not the messy never ending process that software development 
                        is. I wanted a place where I could continue to push myself and share the journey. You can find me a lot on Youtube talking about object oriented
                        programing and the Apex language. But I am also very interested in JavaScript and its frameworks, full stack web development, Heroku,
                        Python.....
